## Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`. `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in terminal.

Work on your code iteratively - aka in small pieces.

To help figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values in the Terminal as follows:

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime); 
}
```

Don't forget the semi-colons!
